# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators. The model is trained and evaluated on a standard heart disease dataset, with the goal of providing a simple and effective tool for early risk detection.
